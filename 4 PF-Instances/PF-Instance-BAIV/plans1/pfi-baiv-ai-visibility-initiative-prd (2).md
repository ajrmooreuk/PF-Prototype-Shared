## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Platform algorithm changes** | High | High | 9 | Diversify across platforms, focus on fundamentals (quality, authority), monitor changes closely | [Owner] |
| **Resource constraints** | Medium | High | 6 | Prioritize ruthlessly, consider outsourcing, build buffer into timeline | [Owner] |
| **Competitive response** | Medium | Medium | 4 | Build sustainable advantages (unique data, deep expertise), speed to market | [Owner] |
| **Content quality issues** | Low | High | 5 | Rigorous review process, SME involvement, quality checklist | [Owner] |
| **Technical implementation delays** | Medium | Medium | 4 | Early technical feasibility check, buffer time, backup resources | [Owner] |
| **Measurement challenges** | High | Medium | 6 | Invest in tracking setup early, use proxy metrics, manual testing initially | [Owner] |
| **Budget overruns** | Low | High | 5 | Detailed budget tracking, phase-gate approach, contingency reserve | [Owner] |

**Risk Score**: Likelihood (1-3) × Impact (1-3) = Score (1-9)
- **Critical (7-9)**: Immediate attention and robust mitigation
- **High (4-6)**: Monitor closely, have mitigation plan ready
- **Low (1-3)**: Acknowledge, check periodically

### Detailed Risk Plans

**Risk: Platform Algorithm Changes**
- **Scenario**: AI platform changes citation algorithm, our visibility drops
- **Early Warning Signs**: Sudden citation rate drops, competitor movements
- **Mitigation**:
  - Diversify across 4+ platforms (don't rely on one)
  - Focus on fundamentals (quality, authority) not tricks
  - Monitor platforms for announced changes
  - Build relationships with platform teams when possible
  - Have quick-response content team ready
- **Contingency**: If major drop occurs, analyze cause within 48 hours, implement fixes within 1 week

**Risk: Resource Constraints**
- **Scenario**: Team bandwidth insufficient, timelines slip
- **Early Warning Signs**: Missed deadlines, quality issues, team burnout
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritize ruthlessly (focus on P0 only if needed)
  - Build 20% buffer into all estimates
  - Identify outsourcing options early (pre-vetted vendors)
  - Regular resource planning reviews
- **Contingency**: If constraints hit, immediately cut P1/P2 items, extend timeline, or add resources
