## 📋 Executive Overview

### What is BAIV?

**BAIV (Be AI Visible)** is an automated platform that helps companies become discoverable and citeable by AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.). As AI-driven search becomes dominant, traditional SEO is no longer sufficient. Companies need:

1. **AI Discovery Optimization** - Be mentioned when AI agents research your industry
2. **Citation Engineering** - Ensure high-authority sources mention your brand
3. **Knowledge Gap Filling** - Create content AI agents need but can't find
4. **Semantic Visibility** - Structure content for AI consumption (Schema.org)
5. **Competitive Intelligence** - Understand where competitors win AI mentions

### The Problem We're Solving

**Current Reality:**
- 40% of searches now start with AI agents, not Google
- Companies have no visibility into AI agent knowledge about their brand
- Traditional SEO metrics (rankings, clicks) miss AI-driven discovery
- Content strategies ignore AI training data and citation patterns
- Competitors gaining "mind share" in AI responses go undetected

**BAIV Solution:**
Automated P1-P7 workflow that:
- ✅ Discovers what AI agents know (and don't know) about your brand
- ✅ Identifies Reddit discussions, sentiment, and pain points
- ✅ Maps 200+ People Also Ask questions to content gaps
- ✅ Scores brand visibility across multiple dimensions
- ✅ Generates 30+ content ideas with schema recommendations
- ✅ Delivers in <3 hours what takes consultants weeks

## 🚨 Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk 1: Reddit API Rate Limits**
- **Impact:** High (discovery incomplete)
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Request higher rate limits from Reddit
  - Implement aggressive caching (7-day TTL)
  - Fall back to web scraping if needed
  - Batch requests efficiently

**Risk 2: AI Agent API Costs**
- **Impact:** High (unit economics)
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Cache AI agent responses (30-day TTL)
  - Use cheaper models for non-critical queries
  - Implement spending caps per workspace
  - Optimize prompts for fewer tokens

**Risk 3: PAA Scraping Reliability**
- **Impact:** High (P3 fails)
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use SerpAPI as primary (paid, reliable)
  - Build proprietary scraper as backup
  - Cache PAA graphs for common keywords
  - Crowdsource PAA updates

**Risk 4: Schema Complexity**
- **Impact:** Medium (user confusion)
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Provide copy-paste code snippets
  - WordPress plugin for one-click schema
  - Video tutorials for implementation
  - Offer implementation service ($500)

**Risk 5: Data Privacy (Reddit, GSC)**
- **Impact:** High (compliance)
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - OAuth for all integrations
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit
  - User data deletion on request
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance from day 1
