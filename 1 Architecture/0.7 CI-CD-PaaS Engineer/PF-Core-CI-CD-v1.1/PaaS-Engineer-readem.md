#VE Value Engineering for PaaS CI CD Engineer
1 Who? Who needs this and who is it for?
Do they value it as much as we do?
Is there an economic opportunity to serve them better?
##Who is the ICP - Ideal Customer Profile
2 Why? - what is the purpose?

Problem,opportunity
3 What? - the product?

4.0 How? - How can the product be most effectively delivered

Agent, Value Prop to PRD ,PBS to WBS, Agent does the Build and Reuseable process

5 When? - when is it needed, how long to build can agents build an automated MVP?
-Priority
-How will we differentiate, Blue Ocean and Competitive Context
Context and Value Engineering inextricably interlinked.
##WHO RRR 
-The roles and perspecitives and raci collaborations that need to be factored into and aligned with optimised and valuable solutions.

###Vision [VSOM] VSOM Agent draws on projection in minds eye of where we are to where we want to be
###Strategy How we will get there
###Objectives SMART Objectives
###Metrics Metrics and integration OKR-KPIs and staged key results
##OKR Objectives by Key Results for PaaS Engineer CIC CD Agent and Environments for Dev Stage and Prod
###Objectives
###Key Results to achieve vison and strategy
###Key Performance Indicators KPIS include leading indicators as to how near/far we are from chieving of the strategy objectives and overall vision.
##VALUE PROPOSITION
See the Value Proposition which gathers context and value enegineering and consideration of PMF and relative prioritisation etc.
See VALUE PROPOSITION  Module specific to the product
This drives and with Context and VSOM, RRR informs the PD Draft

4.1 #How we automate where we can build and config of:
- the PF-Core CI-CD for PaaS that all instances can clone and sub build their PF_instances from and enable sub products from the PF_instance version of the Dev Stage and then integrate re stage and decision point whether to roll to Production.
