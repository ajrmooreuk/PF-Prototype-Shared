## 🎯 What Problem This Solves

### The Challenge
Traditional marketing frameworks treat SEO/visibility as a **tactical activity** buried under digital marketing. But in the AI-disrupted search landscape where ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity answer queries directly:

**❌ If AI doesn't know you exist → No awareness → No revenue**

### The Solution
CMO Framework v2.0 **elevates AI Visibility to strategic imperative**, positioning it as:
- ✅ **Foundational capability** (not a tactic)
- ✅ **Root node** in marketing dependency graph
- ✅ **Strategic pillar** alongside Brand, Customer, Product
- ✅ **C-Suite collaboration** area (not just marketing)
- ✅ **Platform-agnostic** for reuse across ventures
