## 7. Implementation Guidance

### 7.1 Role Adaptation by Company Size

Not all organizations will require all 12 C-Suite roles. The following guidance adapts the structure by company size:

| Company Size | Annual Revenue | Recommended Structure |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Small** | < $50M | CEO, CFO, COO (combined CSCO/CQO/CCO functions) |
| **Medium** | $50M - $250M | CEO, CFO, COO, CSCO, CQO, CRO (CCO under CEO) |
| **Large** | $250M - $1B | Full 12-role structure with possible CTO/CIO combination |
| **Enterprise** | > $1B | Full 12-role structure with regional C-Suite in major markets |

### 7.2 Role Combination Patterns

Where organizations cannot support all roles, the following combination patterns are recommended:

| Combined Role | Comprises | Suitable When |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| COO/CSCO | Operations + Supply Chain | Processing and logistics tightly integrated |
| CQO/CCO | Quality + Compliance | Regulatory compliance primarily quality-driven |
| CTO/CIO | Technology + Information | Technology strategy and data not yet strategic differentiators |
| CFO/CSO | Finance + Strategy | Strategy execution heavily capital-driven |
| CRO/CMO | Revenue + Marketing | Sales and marketing tightly aligned |

### 7.3 VSOM Integration Requirements

Each C-Suite role must integrate with the VSOM framework through:

1. **Vision Alignment:** Role objectives explicitly linked to organizational Vision Statement
2. **Strategic Objectives:** Each role owns or contributes to specific BSC-perspective Strategic Objectives
3. **OKR Cascade:** Role-level OKRs derived from Strategic Objectives with measurable Key Results
4. **KPI Accountability:** Leading and lagging indicators defined for each role's domain
