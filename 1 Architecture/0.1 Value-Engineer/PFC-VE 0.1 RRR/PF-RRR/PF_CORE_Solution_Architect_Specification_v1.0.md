## 1. Executive Summary

The Solution Architect Agent represents a critical orchestrating function within the Platform Foundation Core (PF-Core) architecture. This agent bridges the gap between strategic value engineering (VSOM framework) and technical implementation, ensuring that platform solutions align with organizational objectives while maintaining technical excellence and ontology compliance.

As the primary architectural authority within the agentic platform, the Solution Architect Agent is responsible for translating business requirements into technically sound, ontology-driven solution designs that can be implemented by downstream agents (Database Designer, UI/UX Builder, Integration Agents) while maintaining traceability to the Value Proposition cascade.
