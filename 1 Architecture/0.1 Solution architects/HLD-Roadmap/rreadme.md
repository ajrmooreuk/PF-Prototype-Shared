#Is Context Engineering depreciating value?



Your context engineering is a depreciating asset. ❌


Your knowledge graph is not.


Here's why agentic architecture is splitting in two.


🔧 The scaffolding trap is real. RAG pipelines. Search trees. Chain-of-thought frameworks. All built to compensate for weak models. Frontier models bulldoze these abstractions. Gemini 3.0 / Opus 4.5 dominated benchmarks with no agentic harness at all. Just a terminal.


Knowledge graphs are different. They amplify capability rather than compensate for weakness.


📊 Walmart, Uber, Adobe, and Comcast all hit the same wall. When agents answer complex relational questions, SQL queries become unrunnable. Models either cannot generate them or execution fails.


Graph queries for the same questions are dramatically shorter. Models generate them more reliably despite less training data. Structural simplicity compounds with model capability rather than fighting it.


🏗️ Three layers are emerging.


The model layer handles orchestration. Investment here depreciates as capabilities commoditize.


The knowledge layer provides deterministic reasoning and cross-system intelligence. This investment appreciates with every connection added.


The coordination layer manages multi-agent interactions and governance. Systems of coordination replace systems of record as the strategic asset.


🚀 The 2026 predictions make this urgent.


A single agentic goal triggers thousands of sub-tasks in milliseconds. Current backends interpret this as an attack. Infrastructure must be rebuilt for agent-speed workloads.


Multi-agent collaboration becomes the norm. Agents negotiate, route to specialists, and maintain context. This requires a shared knowledge substrate.


The prompt box dies. Agents observe and intervene proactively. This demands rich contextual understanding only a knowledge layer provides.


🧠 Why graphs endure. Agents need to answer unpredictable questions with multi-hop reasoning. Cause and effect chains. Pattern matching across relationships. Connecting dots across domains. This is exactly what graph databases do deterministically.
The neurosymbolic architecture is emerging. Not every agent decision requires probabilistic model output. Some questions have definitive answers found through deterministic graph traversal. Combining symbolic reasoning with neural reasoning yields more reliable results than either alone.


⚠️ Data entropy becomes the limiting factor. The decay of freshness, structure, and truth in unstructured data breaks agent workflows. RAG hallucinations trace back to messy inputs, not model failures. Startups that extract structure from multimodal chaos hold the keys to enterprise AI. Knowledge graphs are the antidote to entropy because they enforce structure and relationships explicitly.


Context tricks depreciate with every model release. Knowledge graphs appreciate with every connection added.
