## 1. Executive Summary

The PF-Core RRR (Roles, Responsibilities & Rights) framework establishes a comprehensive governance structure for executive accountability across the Platform Foundation Core ecosystem. This catalogue defines **23 C-Suite roles** organized by Balanced Scorecard (BSC) perspectives, enabling clear RACI accountability matrices and strategic alignment.

### 1.1 Strategic Objectives

1. Define clear executive ownership for VSOM strategic objectives across all BSC perspectives
2. Enable systematic OKR cascade from C-Suite to operational teams
3. Establish accountability boundaries for PF-Core transferable modules
4. Support AI agent context awareness for strategic alignment decisions
5. Provide ontology-grounded role definitions for semantic reasoning

---

## 2. RRR Scope Framework

The RRR framework operates across three dimensions that cascade from strategic vision to operational execution:

### 2.1 Roles Dimension

Defines **WHO** is accountable for specific strategic domains. Roles are mapped to BSC perspectives ensuring balanced organizational coverage. Each role has defined scope across PF-Core instances (BAIV, AIR, W4M).

### 2.2 Responsibilities Dimension

Defines **WHAT** each role must deliver. Responsibilities are outcome-oriented and directly linked to VSOM strategic objectives and OKR frameworks. They cascade through the organizational hierarchy:

```
C-Suite → VP → Director → Manager → Individual Contributor
```

### 2.3 Rights Dimension

Defines the **AUTHORITY** granted to execute responsibilities. Rights include decision-making authority, budget control, resource allocation, and approval powers. Rights are bounded by governance policies and escalation protocols.

---

## 3. Balanced Scorecard Perspective Alignment

All C-Suite roles are mapped to one or more BSC perspectives to ensure strategic balance and prevent metric myopia:

| Perspective | Focus Areas | Role Count |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Financial** | Revenue growth, profitability, cost optimization, cash flow, ROI | 3 |
| **Customer** | Satisfaction, market share, retention, brand value, lifetime value | 6 |
| **Internal Process** | Operational efficiency, quality, innovation capability, risk management | 5 |
| **Learning & Growth** | Employee development, knowledge management, technology capabilities | 6 |
| **Stakeholder** | Partner relationships, community impact, investor relations, compliance | 1 |

## 6. RACI Integration Framework

The RRR framework integrates with RACI accountability matrices through the following mappings:

### 6.1 RACI Definitions

- **Responsible (R):** The role that performs the work to complete the task
- **Accountable (A):** The role that is ultimately answerable for the task completion
- **Consulted (C):** The roles that provide input and expertise
- **Informed (I):** The roles that need to be kept updated on progress

### 6.2 RRR-to-RACI Mapping

| RRR Dimension | RACI Element | Description |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Rights** | Accountable (A) | Rights define who can be ultimately accountable |
| **Responsibilities** | Responsible (R) | Responsibilities define what must be delivered |
| **BSC Perspective** | Consulted (C) / Informed (I) | Perspective alignment determines stakeholders |

### 6.3 Cascade Pattern

```
CEO (A) → C-Suite Role (R) → VP (R) → Director (R) → Manager (R) → IC (R)
     ↓
  Board (I)    Peer Executives (C)           Team Members (I)
```
